# NEED: creates argparse object and passes to parse_args function
# NEED: creates Ball object to be run, initialized with core args
# NEED: creates ScreenWriter object, initialized with core args
# NEED: For however long the video lasts, grab the next frame from Ball with something like nextFrame().
#       Probably returns info of position, color, major and minor axis.
# NEED: Pass relevant info to ScreenWriter and append result to images list
# NEED: Save images.
